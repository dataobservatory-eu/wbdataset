\usage{
get_property_definition(
  pid,
  languages = c("en", "nl", "hu"),
  wikibase_api_url = "https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php",
  return_type = "JSON"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pid}{The PID of the property in the Wikibase instance (or Wikidata
itself).}

\item{languages}{Defaults to \code{c("en", "nl", "hu")}. A character string
of the languages in which the users wants to receive the labels and
descriptions of the property. The vector of languages must use BCP
47-compliant language tags (e.g., "en" for English, "nl" for Dutch and "hu"
ofr Hungarian.)}

\item{wikibase_api_url}{Defaults to
\code{"https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php"}, may be replaced with a similar
API address of a Wikibase instance. Private instances may require an
authenticated session.}

\item{return_type}{Defaults to \code{"data.frame"} that is suitable for receiving
the information in stand-alone use. The \code{"JSON"} passes on a JSON
string in the format that you may need it in further Wikibase API calls.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of the \code{PID} with the labels and descriptions of
the property in the selected languages. Alternatively, when
\code{return_type="JSON"}, the same data prepared for use in a subsequent
API call, for example, to copy these contents into a new Wikibase instance.
}
\description{
Receive the label and description of a property on the basis of
its PID from a Wikibase instance. It will not add further statements about
the property.
}
\details{
Currently the languages choose a default, "en", for cases where the
user-chosen language return empty labels and descriptions. This feature may
be elaborated or changed later. The function receives aliases (alternative
labels), too, but does not return them; the format of aliases needs to be
decided in view of how other functions will use them, as aliases themselves
can break the tidiness of the returned data.
}
\examples{
# Receive a data.frame for further use
get_property_definition(pid = "P2047", return_type = "data.frame")
# Receive JSON for copying with wbeditidentiy
get_property_definition(pid = "P2047", languages = c("en", "hu"))
}
